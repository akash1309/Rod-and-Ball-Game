Game Insights:

This Game is basically a complex version of simple Ball and Rod game.
In it, the rod will always be moving independent of the fact whether you have pressed
the keyboard right or left key.
It will be moving with the same initial speed whether a user presses a key or not but its
position can be changed according to the situation by the user.

How to Play :

When the ball is approaching bottom surface,
the user have to change the position of the rod in such a way that the ball lands on the rod.
Doing so will fetch him points , otherwise the game will end.
